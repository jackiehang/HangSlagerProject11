 * This class represents an error in a Bantam Java program that is severe enough
 * that the compilation process cannot continue.
 * Examples of such situations:
 *      the file to be compiled cannot be found or cannot be read
 *      the parser cannot continue because an ERROR token was found by the scanner
 *      the code generator cannot run because the semantic analyzer found errors.
 * The compiler throws this exception whenever it finds such an error.
